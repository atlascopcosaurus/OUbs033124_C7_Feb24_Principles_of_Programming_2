Compile-time polymorphism, as traditionally understood in the context of programming languages like C++ or Java, involves method overloading or operator overloading where the decision about which method or operation to execute is made at compile time. However, Python's approach to polymorphism differs due to its dynamic typing and interpreted nature. Python doesn't support traditional compile-time polymorphism because it is a dynamically typed language and does not compile code in the same way statically typed languages do. Instead, Python resolves method calls at runtime, making its polymorphism inherently runtime (dynamic) rather than compile-time (static).

### Method Overloading in Python
Python does not support method overloading in the same way that statically typed languages do. Since Python is dynamically typed and uses late binding, it decides which method to call at runtime, and it allows only one method with a given name within a class. However, you can achieve a similar effect to method overloading by defining methods that accept variable numbers of arguments or keyword arguments, allowing them to handle different types or numbers of inputs:

```python
class Example:
    def display(self, *args):
        if len(args) == 1:
            print("Got a single argument:", args[0])
        elif len(args) == 2:
            print("Got two arguments:", args[0], "and", args[1])
        else:
            print("Got multiple arguments:", args)

# Usage
e = Example()
e.display(1)
e.display(1, 2)
e.display(1, 2, 3)
```

### Operator Overloading in Python
Python does support operator overloading, allowing objects of custom classes to be manipulated or compared using built-in operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.). This is achieved by defining special methods in the class (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, etc.):

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

# Usage
p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
result = p1 + p2
print(f"Result: ({result.x}, {result.y})")
```

### Dynamic Nature of Python
In Python, all types of polymorphism, including what might be considered compile-time polymorphism in statically typed languages, are achieved through its dynamic typing and runtime behavior. The flexibility of Python's type system and its capability to handle different types and numbers of arguments at runtime allow it to support polymorphic behavior without the need for compile-time decisions.

In summary, while Python does not support compile-time polymorphism in the traditional sense due to its dynamic nature, it offers flexibility through mechanisms like variable argument lists, keyword arguments, and operator overloading to achieve similar effects.
